# 📁 GitHub Workflow Practice

Welcome to my `github-workflow` repository! This project is a part of my Kalvium learning sprint, where I practiced setting up a GitHub repository using real-world version control habits.

---

## 🛠 Purpose

This repository demonstrates a professional GitHub workflow with:

- A single `main` branch (no feature branches)
- Direct, atomic commits with clear messages
- Clean commit history and version control habits

---

## ✅ What I Practiced

- Initializing and cloning a GitHub repository
- Making meaningful changes locally
- Writing clear and descriptive commit messages
- Pushing changes directly to the `main` branch
- Viewing and verifying commit history on GitHub

---

## 📄 Commit Examples

- `Added project README with purpose and steps`
- `Updated README with version control practices`

---

## 💡 Learning Outcome

This task helped me understand the importance of:

- Clean commit history
- Descriptive commit messages
- Avoiding messy pushes or unnecessary branches

---

## 📷 Submission Note

A screenshot of this repository (showing commit history, main branch, and updated README) has been submitted as part of this assignment.
